# Research Internship
The internship focuses on the development of a pytorch-based library to achieve the optimization of dynamic neural fields. The problem of optimizing dynamic neural fields has already been studied with particle swarm (PSO) approaches. Taking into account the strong development of deep learning frameworks and the ease with which an optimization problem can be defined there to carry out an optimization on GPU, we propose to exploit these frameworks to experiment the optimization of dynamic neural fields by gradient descent.
